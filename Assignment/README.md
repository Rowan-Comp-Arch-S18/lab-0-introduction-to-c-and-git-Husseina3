# Lab 0: Introduction to C Programming and Git.
This lab is mainly dedicated for a qucik review on C programming and a good introduction to git (for some of us). In this assigment the following 11 different math operations were implemented. 
             * + Add 
             * - Subtract 
             * * Multiply 
             * / Divide 
             * % Modulus 
             * < Left Shift 
             * > Right Shift 
             * & Bitwise AND 
             * | Bitwise OR
             * ^ Bitwise XOR 
             * ~ Bitwise Inverse 
## Operations and their functions

Operator  |  Function  | Use
--------  | ---------- |------
   +      |     Add    | num1 + num2 
   -      |   Subtract | (num1 - num2)
   *      |   Multiply | (num1 * num2)
   /      |    Divide  | (num1 / num2)
   %      |   Modulus  | (num1 % num2)
   <      | Left Shift | (num1 << num2)
   >      |Right Shift | (num1 >> num2)
   &      |Bitwise AND | (num1 & num2)
   |      |Bitwise OR  | (num1  num2)
   ^      |Bitwise XOR | (num1 ^ num2)
   ~      |Bitwise Inverse| (~num1) 
 
# Getting Started 
The name of the fuction that implements the operations is * **math** *. This function has a return value type of intiger (**int**). The variables the are used as operands to the operations are *num1* and *num2*. They both have integer value type. Which means the operands that the different math operations are going to be performed on can only be integers. 

The **result** variable was also declared under the function " *math* ". It also have an integer value type. The **result** variable gets the result of the different operations. 

# Softwares used.
*Composer Cide Studio
*Gitkraken
*Bracket code editor.

Russel Trafford is our lab manager for Introduction to Embedded Systems. He was generous enough to provide us with a Example codes, READMEs with detaled descriptions, most of all a header file with a prototype and nicely crafted documentation.
